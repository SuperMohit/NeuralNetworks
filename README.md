#Bias in neural network needed?
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2480650/role-of-bias-in-neural-networks

A simpler way to understand what the bias is: it is somehow similar to the coefficient b of a linear function

y = ax + b

It allows you to move the line up and down to fit the prediction with the data better. Without b the line always goes through the origin (0, 0) and you may get a poorer fit.
